EditID3 library for Android
===================


**EditID3** is a C++ library for Android that enables fast and efficient creation or modification of [ID3v2 metadata tags](http://id3.org/) for MP3 files. It is based off of a heavily modified version of the C library [*id3v2lib*](https://github.com/larsbs/id3v2lib), but was refactored to use C++ to improve performance, security, and reliability.
